## Hobbies / Interests
In my spare time I enjoy challenging myself by learning about and implementing new technologies. I actually buy enterprise networking & server hardware from recyclers, sometimes obscure hardware, that I’ll initially not know how to use and I’ll just experiment with it until I do. This has been very successful over the past 10 years of my career. I do basically the same things with programming and electrical engineering.
