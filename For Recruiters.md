I don’t have a specific role I would like. Just a wish list:

- A commitment to creating an inclusive environment to those who are neurodivergent (Autism, ADHD).
  - Everyone else too, this is just specifically the issue I suffer with.
  - Something that gives me as much autonomy as possible to figure out my own way of working, which is a reasonable adjustment requirement.
- No on-call work.
- At least 2 of these:
  - Tackles issues at scale.
  - Continual service improvement as a requirement, not an afterthought.
  - Implements new services.
  - Infrastructure engineering.
  - Process automation.
  - 3rd line.
- Something that typically doesn’t involve a lot of end user engagement, if any at all.
  - I don't mind talking to people. It's just that I've been there, done that. While I enjoyed it, working a helpdesk role wasn’t really challenging me.
- Is around 1hr or less by bus / train from my location.
  - OR Is a work from home arrangement where getting to the office or datacentre is so infrequent that I could just grab a taxi and it wouldn’t eat into my funds as much as getting the bus each day.
  - OR would fund a taxi journey there and back out of their pocket.
  - OR pays me enough to move closer and gives me enough time to gather the funds to put down a deposit in the interim.

My location can vary. This is because I know people I can move in with, in a number of locations. The same rules apply for both.

If you would like to contact me to understand better any of the above and see where I can fit into your business, or one you're acting as a recruiter for, feel free to drop me an email or phone call.
